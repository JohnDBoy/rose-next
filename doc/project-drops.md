# Drops — the endgame loot tier

Karkia stage 5. **The wiring is done; no loot is authored yet.** This is the plan for
the content pass, plus everything about the drop system that is not obvious from the
code. Companion to [doc/karkia-roadmap.md](karkia-roadmap.md).

---

## 1. Where this stands

`scripts/rewire-karkia-drops.py` (applied 2026-09-07, idempotent, `--restore`able)
fixed the plumbing. **Karkia currently drops nothing.** That is deliberate — it was
previously dropping *the wrong thing*, and correct-and-empty is a better base to
author onto than plausible-and-wrong.

What it corrected:

- Karkia's own drop tables were **831/832/835/851–854**, copied verbatim from Jrose.
  Three of those are live for our own monsters — 831 Desert Scavenger, 832 Agitated
  Desert Scavenger, and **851 Fearsome Terrasaurus King**, our top boss. Authoring
  Karkia loot into them would have handed it to Oro. They are now **900–906**,
  keeping Jrose's own grouping (one shared table for the Cemetery roster, one for
  Spire Village, one per boss).
- Karkia's **zone fallback** (see §2) resolved to `ITEM_DROP` rows 86, 87, 88, 131,
  133–136 and 144 — which were live tables for thirteen of our own low-level
  monsters (Melt Dut, Moss Ant, Moss Golem, the Pomics, the Rackies, Beetle,
  Assistant Chef Woopie). Rows 86 and 87 are literally named *"EVE Zone (Fishing
  System)"* and *"(Farming System)"*. Those tables moved to **940–948** with their
  users repointed, so the zone numbers are Karkia's now.
- Drop chance (`col 20`) went **20 → 80**, our own level-200+ median. At 20, ~80% of
  Karkia's rolls fell through to the zone table; that is what players were picking up.

| | Karkia table |
|---|---|
| Cemetery roster (20 monsters) | 900 |
| Revived Quarantine Officer | 901 |
| D-Seed | 902 |
| Hebarn Officer Pazugenti | 903 |
| Hebarn Officer Scylla Mira | 904 |
| Corroded Golem + Revived Veteran | 905 |
| Spire Village roster (10, incl. Drake α) | 906 |
| zone fallback, per zone | 86, 87, 88, 131, 133–136, 144 |

---

## 2. How the drop system actually works

From `CCal::Get_DropITEM` (`src/common/calculation.cpp:132`). Worth reading before
touching any of this — three of its properties are surprising.

```
drop_var = (WorldDROP + col20 - rand(1..100) - (levelgap + 16)*3.5 - 10 + dropRate) * 0.38
if drop_var <= 0                     -> no drop at all
if rand(1..100) <= col19             -> money instead of an item
if col20 - rand(1..100) >= 0         -> table = col 18   (the monster's own)
else                                 -> table = the ZONE NUMBER
cell = ITEM_DROP[table][1 + rand(0..min(drop_var, 30))]
```

- **A drop-table id and a zone id are the same namespace.** There is no separation.
  This is why Karkia's zone numbers were already somebody's loot table, and it will
  happen again to any content imported at a new zone number. Check both before
  allocating.
- **`col 20` is doing three jobs at once**: how often anything drops, how wide a
  slice of the table is reachable, and how often the zone fallback is used. It is not
  a clean "drop rate" knob.
- **A cell is `type * 1000 + number`**, so `item.m_cType = cell / 1000` and
  `m_nItemNo = cell % 1000`. **Item numbers above 999 cannot be dropped**, full stop.
  That is a tighter limit than the item *encoding*, which `tagBaseITEM` widened to an
  11-bit number (0–2047) — the drop table simply cannot address them.
- Cells valued **1–4 are redirect groups**, re-rolled at column `26 + value*5 +
  rand(5)`. A table therefore has a common section (columns 1–25) and four rarity
  buckets (26–50). `ITEM_DROP.STB` has 51 columns.
- `Get_DropITEM` returns false outright when the player is **10+ levels above** the
  monster, so lowering a monster's level can silently kill its drops.

---

## 3. What we can and cannot drop

**Resolved 2026-09-08: everything is droppable now.** The table below was the state
before the drop encoding was widened; it is kept because the *reason* still matters
when reading old tables.

| set | ids | droppable before | now |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jrose weapons (`project_jrose_weapon_import`) | 1381–1453 | **0 of 73** — all above 999 | **73 of 73** |
| Jrose back items (`project_jrose_back_import`) | 957–1061 | 43 of 105 (957–999 only) | **105 of 105** |
| Jrose shields (`project_jrose_subwpn_import`) | 308–342 | 35 of 35 | 35 of 35 |

`src/common/include/rose/common/drop_item_code.h` gives drop cells the same wide form
shops already had — `type * 100000 + id` above 999 — and the three readers now share
it. The ranges cannot collide (legacy tops out at 31,999), and **all 10,421 non-zero
cells in `ITEM_DROP.STB` decode bit-for-bit as before**; there were no wide cells and
the 1,039 sentinels are all legitimate 1–4 redirect groups.

The trap worth remembering: `CLIB_GameSRV::CheckSTB_DropITEM` runs at server start-up
and **zeroes** any cell whose type it cannot make sense of. A decoder ignorant of the
wide form would not merely skip a wide cell — it would delete it at load, so the table
would look fine on disk and be empty in memory. That is why the sanitiser is one of
the three sites, alongside `CCal::Get_DropITEM` and the Monster Inspector's list.

Ceiling is now the wire format, not the packing: `tagBaseITEM` is 5 bits of type and
**11** of item number, so ids up to 2047 drop.

The imported Jrose weapon sets **cannot be loot** without changing the cell encoding.
Options, in increasing order of cost: sell them from a Karkia NPC in stage 6 (free,
and stage 6 is coming anyway); make them quest rewards; or widen the drop encoding,
which touches shared client/server code and every existing table's meaning. **The
shop is the recommendation** — it also gives Karkia's NPCs a reason to exist.

**Resolved by stage 6d, and better than expected.** `Rose::Store::encode_store_item`
already has a **wide form** — `type * 100000 + no` for ids above 999 — supported by
the client, the server *and* the shop editor. So the shop route needed no encoding
work at all. Drops have since been given the same form (§3), so the wall is gone on
both sides.

`scripts/add-karkia-shops.py` sells two of the tiers and **reserves three for
drops**, chosen so Karkia never duplicates Oro (whose merchant Huzam sells 210 and
230 from tabs 5 and 6):

| tier | ids | where |
|---|---|---|
| lv215 "Mirere" (13, all weapon types) | 1381, 1384, 1387, 1390, 1393, 1396, 1399, 1402, 1405, 1408, 1411, 1414, 1417 | **shop** (Gelt) |
| the Rose set (13, all weapon types; lv225, **lv100 since 2026-10-20**) | 1382, 1385, 1388, 1391, 1394, 1397, 1400, 1403, 1406, 1409, 1412, 1415, 1418 | **shop** (Gelt; since 2026-10-20 Luna: Pavrick, Sergei, Pabel -- `weapon-ladder-pass.py`) |
| lv220 (11) | 1426–1436 | **reserved for drops** |
| lv235 (10) | 1437–1446 | **reserved for drops** |
| lv240 (13, the mythical names) | 1383, 1386, 1389, 1392, 1395, 1398, 1401, 1404, 1407, 1410, 1413, 1416, 1419 | **reserved for drops** |

Left out of both: the partial lv210 set (1420–1425; 1424 Photon Cannon is the lv230 Arcidian line's
launcher since 2026-10-20, the other five share its models and are retired, sold and dropped nowhere, until they get models of their own) duplicates Oro's tier, and the
low oddments (1447–1453, levels 150–205) sit far below Karkia's 215–240 band.

The lv240 set — Bahamut, Phoenix, Griffon, Unicorn, Albion, Quetzalcoatl, Aerie,
Catoblepas, Oberon, Mermaid, Spriggan, Giranda, Hellhound — is the crown tier and
belongs on the bosses (§4d), and **as of 2026-09-08 it can drop** — that was the last
thing blocked on the encoding. `add-karkia-shops.py --verify` proves none of the 34
reserved weapons has leaked into any shop tab.

## 4. The content plan

Three layers, in the order they should be authored.

### 4a. Materials as the backbone

The filler that stops a kill feeling empty, and it feeds crafting. Cheap, uses items
we already have, and it is what our own tables are mostly made of — our best live
endgame tables (940–942, ex-Moss Golem/Ant, level 200–210) run roughly **15–20
material cells to 4–8 use-item cells**, which is the ratio to copy.

Candidates already in `LIST_NATURAL`, at the tier Karkia sits in:

| | |
|---|---|
| metals | `12:8` Chromium, `12:9` Tiar, `12:10` Damascus, `12:16` Orihalcon, `12:17` Adamantium |
| woods | `12:37` Cinnamon, `12:38` Red Sandalwood, `12:39` Otherworldly, `12:40` Sephiroth |
| leathers | `12:47` Thick, `12:48` Hard, `12:49` Transparent, `12:50` Patterned |
| cloth | `12:59` Twill |

Karkia is a dead world of ruins and undead, so the flavour argument is for **metals,
leather and bone over wood** — Spire Village and the Cemetery should not read like a
forest. That is the one place to deviate from copying our existing tables wholesale.

### 4b. Use items as the reliable second layer

`10:13` Vital Water (XL), `10:32` Spiritual Water (XL), `10:157` HP Point (+1000),
`10:167` MP Point (+700), `10:171` Stamina. An endgame zone that funds its own
potion consumption is doing something useful even before the rare drops land.

### 4c. The imported Jrose sets as the signature drops

**This is the part that makes Karkia's loot feel like Karkia's.** The 35 shields
(`308–342`) and the 43 addressable back items (`957–999`) came from the same client
as Karkia itself, they are already in with art and stats — and **they currently have
no source anywhere in the game**. Karkia is where they should come from. It closes
`project_jrose_subwpn_import` and half of `project_jrose_back_import`.

Put them in the rarity buckets (columns 26–50), not the common section.

### 4d. Bosses

Each already has its own table (903–906). They should carry the best of §4c at a
much better rate, and are the natural home for anything we do not want in the field.

Note `NPC_DROP_MONEY` (`col 19`) is **0 across our entire game**, Karkia included —
nothing drops money today. Worth deciding deliberately rather than inheriting.

## 4e. Built — the numbers as shipped  *(DONE, 2026-09-08)*

`scripts/add-karkia-drops.py`. 9 tables + 2 zone mirrors, 11 rows written.

Measured by simulating `Get_DropITEM` faithfully over 600k kills per case, not
estimated:

| | Cemetery 900 (lv215-228) | Alphas 906 (lv228-240) | Boss 903 (lv240) |
|---|---|---|---|
| materials | 38.7% | 38.6% | 12.2% |
| use items | 7.3% | 3.8% | 3.8% |
| **shield** | **1 in 30** | **1 in 30** | 1 in 13 |
| **weapon** | **1 in 33** | **1 in 15** | **38%** (mythical) |
| money | 15.1% | 15.0% | 0% |
| nothing | 32.5% | 32.7% | 38.4% |

Three things worth keeping:

- **The zone rows 87 and 88 mirror 900 and 906.** `col 20` = 80 sends **20% of
  every roll to the row numbered after the zone**, so without the mirrors a fifth
  of all rolls hit an empty table and every rate above loses 20% — shields would
  be 1 in 37, not 1 in 30. This is the cheapest way to make the fallback harmless.
- **Money fires *instead of* an item**, so `col 19` is not free: at 15% it takes
  15% off the item rate. Bosses are set to **0** so it can never eat a mythical
  roll. A money drop pays ~2,000 z at lv215 and ~2,500 z at lv240; at 15% that is
  ~319 z/kill, so a 768,000 z shop weapon is ~2,400 kills. Raise `WORLD_VAR_DROP_M`
  (default 100) if that reads as too slow — it is a live GM-settable world var,
  not a table edit.
- **906 carries three redirects, not two**, so weapons run 1 in 15 there against
  1 in 33 in the Cemetery. Deliberate: it is the only cap-level farm and has twice
  the weapon pool (10 lv235 against 5 lv220).

**Both Drakes were bosses sharing a trash table** — 2729 pointed at 900 and 2699
at 906, so they dropped exactly what the mobs around them did. They now have rows
907 and 908.

Verified that `CLIB_GameSRV::CheckSTB_DropITEM` zeroes **nothing**: all 9,570
decodable cells in the whole table survive it, including the 66 new wide-encoded
weapon cells. That check matters because the sanitiser deletes what it cannot
parse rather than ignoring it.

The level gap does the rest of the work: a level-240 player gets **100% nothing**
from the Cemetery, which is what makes 906 the only cap farm rather than a
preference.

---

## 5. Oro — built  *(DONE, 2026-09-16)*

Oro had the same defect and a worse wiring: every monster pointed at an empty table
in 773–870 (empty in every dump we own — RoseZA never authored them, and 667 keeps
per-monster drops inline in its own `LIST_NPC` cols 88–102 against its own item
numbering, so neither could be copied), the 19 species the 667 import added carried
`col 20` = 100 (every roll to the empty table), and the rest fell through 20% of the
time to rows 71–85 — the Eldeon Ikaness and Sikuku tables and the Junon town NPCs',
two of them still titled *"MVP Zone (1P-VS-Kings)"* and *"TVT Zone"*. Money was 0.

`scripts/add-oro-drops.py` does the rewire and the content in one pass, importing
`build_row`/`encode` and the item pools from `add-karkia-drops.py` so the two
continents share one encoding and one calibration. `scripts/import-oro-materials.py`
first brings nine RoseZA monster parts into `LIST_NATURAL` (Asper Fang, Snapper Beak,
Devourer Plate, …). Its lesson repeats §4a's: rows 273/274 are blank in the STB but
the STL still names them Archangel/Archdevil Feather and drop tables 63–71 reference
them, so the Snapper parts went to 285/286 and the rune piece to 287.

Design choices, and why:

- **One table per species**, not per roster (col 18 left alone): the materials are
  named for the family that drops them, and a shared table pays them from the wrong
  animal. The table is generated, so 57 rows cost the same as four.
- **Weapons are what Karkia left unused**: the Jrose lv210 set 1420–1425 with 1447/1450
  in the Golden Ring, then the shared lv220 and lv235 pools. Five-wide windows rotate
  through the pool per species.
- **The lv240 armour is Oro's signature**, as the mythical weapons are Karkia's. It was
  drop-only since the armour pass and dropped nowhere. Body and cap come from the
  Fossil Sanctuary's field buckets, gauntlets and boots from its four kings.
- **Oro pays a little less than Karkia, on purpose.** Field tables fill 10 slots
  (12 in the Sanctuary) against Karkia's 12, and a Sanctuary king's armour rate is
  held at a Karkia boss's mythical rate, not above it (a first cut with body/cap
  buckets on the kings too measured 50% and was taken back down).

Measured with `--simulate` (a faithful `Get_DropITEM`, zone fallback going to the
zone row), 300k kills per shape at level parity:

| | Ring/Wasteland field | Sanctuary field | Ring/Wasteland king | Sanctuary king |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| materials | 30.4% | 30.4% | 17.8% | 15.8% |
| use items | 8.3% | 8.3% | 5.1% | 4.5% |
| **shield** | 1 in 26 | 1 in 26 | 9.3% | 7.7% |
| **weapon** | 1 in 29 | 1 in 29 | **24.9%** | — |
| **lv240 armour** | — | **1 in 20** (body/cap) | — | **37.6%** (gauntlets/boots) |
| money | 15% | 15% | 0% | 0% |
| nothing | 39% | 34% | 43% | 34% |

Zone rows 71/78/79/81/83/85 hold a generic table for their tier so the 20% fallback
is live; the legacy tables that sat there moved to 949–954 with their users repointed
(the same relocation `rewire-karkia-drops.py` did for 86–144). Zones 72/73/80 spawn
nothing and were left alone.

`--restore` is cell-level for both STBs. After running: restart the servers and
re-bake the VFS (the Monster Inspector reads these tables client-side).

---

## 6. Open questions

- Should Karkia drop **our** endgame weapons (ids ≤ 999), or stay materials- and
  armour-flavoured so weapons stay a shop/quest reward?
- Money drops: leave at 0 like the rest of the game, or make Karkia the exception?
- The three placeholder zones (131/133/144) still spawn only a level-2 Jelly Bean
  (roadmap §4, decision 4). Their zone tables exist and are empty; leave them until
  the zones are populated.
