"""Monster identity by icon: role profiles on spawned monsters (2026-10-15).

The icon beside a monster's name (LIST_NPC col 27) says what it is, but the old balance
passes had flattened the roles: Guard, Fighter and Warrior sat within 10% of Basic on
every stat, the stars were no ladder (bronze 1.4x HP, silver 1.6x, gold 5.2x), and Basic
was a grab-bag (ATK 0.22-1.24x, DEF 0.72-3x the level trend). The user's design, checked
in the combat simulator (class sweep, fights against each icon relative to a Basic of the
same level):

    icon        identity                         result vs Basic (kill time / damage taken)
    Guard       a wall: long to kill, hits soft  1.55 / 0.71
    Fighter     balanced, slightly aggressive    1.00 / 1.15
    Warrior     heavy hitter, softer             1.00 / 1.62
    Ranger      ranged, fragile, evasive         1.00 / 1.17
    Hunter      ranged, bigger slower shots      0.68 / 0.88
    Magician    magic damage, soft, resistant    1.00 / 0.96
    Leader      bronze star: a tougher leader    1.70 / 0.92
    Captain     silver star: a mini-fight        7.6  / 1.89
    Sub-boss    gold star: two-player content    solo wins ~25%, a duo ~100%

Monster damage grows much faster than ATK (damage follows ATK minus the player's
defence), so the ATK gaps are narrower than they look: a first draft at Warrior ATK 1.3
made Warriors hit 2.1x and Guards at 0.8 nearly harmless.

How: TARGET is each icon's stat as a multiple of the level trend (the median of
plain-role spawned monsters within 10 levels). Per icon and stat one factor moves the
icon's median onto its target, so every monster keeps its own quirks. Plain roles average
about 1 on each stat. Basic's extremes are then tidied into [TIDY_LO, TIDY_HI] x the
trend (critters matter in AoE fights). Kings and skulls are untouched (group content),
as are rows the trend excludes (balance-trend-exclude.py: hand-tuned imports such as the
Cerberus Lair).

Clan-field bosses (CLAN_BOSSES: the Junon Clan Field Guardians, Astarot, Astarot King)
are clan content, "a five-player job": HP x CLAN_HP, ATK x CLAN_ATK on their own values.
Simulated with HP and attacks split over the group: solo ~20%, a duo ~40%, five ~90%.
The Luna Clan Field's regular monsters (CLAN_DUO: Tirwins, Elec Ghosts) are two-player
content on top of their role: HP x DUO_HP, ATK x DUO_ATK (solo ~35%, a duo ~85%).

Kings and skulls (BOSS_HP): early kings below level 80 and kings are for three players,
skulls for five (scaled back from five / ten on 2026-10-16: the alpha pool is 5-6 players) (four field elites that wore a skull
are silver stars now, fix-monster-marks.py). HP only: each boss's multiplier (x2.35 ..
x41.66, frozen from the sim) puts its fight at ~45 s / 90 s / 3 min for its group (sim, at
the first group sizes: 42-67 s, 72-117 s, 149-202 s). Not the Desert of the Dead's four (PvPvE zone, later).
The ten bosses that never cast a skill (NOSKILL_BOSSES) get ATK x NOSKILL_ATK instead;
skills weaker than the boss's swing got a boss-only copy (boost-boss-skills.py).

This is a layer, applied last. The older monster passes (rebalance-karkia.py,
-oro-667.py, -endgame-curve.py, -oro-bosses.py, -eldeon-outliers.py, -exp-rewards.py) read
LIST_NPC without it (balance-trend-exclude.without_roles) and refuse to write while it is
applied, so they keep their own view. EXP stays priced on the pre-role HP (to be decided).
Note those passes already failed their own --verify before this one existed; the user
considers them outdated.

    python scripts/rebalance-monster-roles.py --dry-run
    python scripts/rebalance-monster-roles.py
    python scripts/rebalance-monster-roles.py --verify
    python scripts/rebalance-monster-roles.py --restore

Cell-level manifest in build/monster-roles/ ([pre-role, written] per cell); restore puts
back the cells that still hold what this pass wrote. The server reads LIST_NPC: restart it,
and re-bake the VFS. `data/` is gitignored, so this file is the record.
